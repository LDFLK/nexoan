# Query API

## Implement OpenAPI Contract

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**  
You should have the Ballerina version of **2201.11.0** in your device.

The Ballerina service can be generated by the following command. 

> üí° Note: Always make sure the contract has the expected endpoints and request params
> before working on the code. The generated endpoints should not be editable at all. 
> Maybe the only changes that can be done is adding error handlers, but request and response
> must be defined in the contract. 

```bash
bal openapi -i ../contracts/rest/query_api.yaml --mode service
```

## Generate GRPC Stubs

The client stub generated here will be sending and receiving values via Grpc. 
This will send requests to the corresponding CRUD server endpoint. 

```bash
bal grpc --mode client --input ../crud-api/protos/types_v1.proto --output .
```

## Development

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**  
All the commands here are for the **LINUX** & **macOS**, but they work on the **Windows** too. but for the commands which does not works on the **Windows** We have given the working command by mentioning that. Please look for that.

For LINUX & macOS
```bash
cd design/query-api
cp env.template .env
# update the required fields to set the environment variables
# (you can find the example env configurations here)
source .env
# make sure crud service is running
bal test
bal run
```

For windows (make sure you open the **Powershell CLI**)
```bash
cd design/query-api
echo .env
# after updating the required fields to be added to the environment
# you have to copy and paste the env configurations on the Powershell CLI
# (you can find the example env configurations here)
# make sure crud service is running
bal test
bal run
```

Example .env configurations
```bash
# For LINUX & macOS
export CRUD_SERVICE_HOST=localhost
export CRUD_SERVICE_PORT=50051
export QUERY_SERVICE_HOST=localhost
export QUERY_SERVICE_PORT=8081

# For Windows (paste on Powershell CLI)
$env:CRUD_SERVICE_HOST="localhost"
$env:CRUD_SERVICE_PORT="50051"
$env:QUERY_SERVICE_HOST="localhost"
$env:QUERY_SERVICE_PORT="8081"
```
